# ECM3420 Learning from Data - CWK1

## Instructions

To run the project, first install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. You may wish to create and active a virtual environment to do this. If you do not, skip steps 1 and 2:

1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can then run the notebook using the `jupyter notebook coursework1_template.ipynb` command. I suggest selecting `Restart & Clear Output` under the `Kernel` header to ensure that all cells execute in the correct order.
